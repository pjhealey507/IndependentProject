For week 3 I created the randomly generated map. At the beginning
of the game, a grid of tilemap rooms will be set in front of the 
player. The width and height of the grid can be changed easily. 
The player will move horizontally through each row, and at the 
end of the row move vertically to the next row. 

I also finished the moving enemy. The moving enemy will stay a 
certain distance away from the player, shooting at a fixed 
interval in the direction of the player. The enemy and enemy 
bullets are also RewindableObjects, meaning that they will 
rewind whenever the player is rewinding.
