For weeks 5+6 I was not able to make as much progress as usual 
due to illness. I was able to add a global hue shift effect as 
an indicator that the player had taken damage and a global 
black-and-white effect for when the player was rewinding. I 
also made some progress on a main menu and an indicator when an
enemy has taken damage.
