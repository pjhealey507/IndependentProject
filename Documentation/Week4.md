For week 4 I made new sprites for the player, walls, bullets, and
enemies. I also added a global bloom effect so that the new 
sprites would glow. Players, bullets, and enemies also have a glow
underneath them that will illuminate the nearest walls. I also 
added dedicated starting and ending rooms with tutorial text and 
a finish line.
