For week 2 I reworked the movement system to use physics. The 
main reason for this was for more exact collisions, but the 
ability to control acceleration and deceleration is also very
useful. I also made a stationary hazard, introducing the HP
system to the game. I started working on a moving enemy, but I
have had some trouble with the AI in relation to the new 
movement system.
